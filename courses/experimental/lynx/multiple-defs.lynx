//in this example, the goal is for one object to have multiple definitions and force tehm all to be consistent
for example, a slider and a text representation of a number
window = new group
    childElements = new set
        subset1:number.textRep

num = new number
    textRep: new textNumber
    sliderRep: new slider

slider = new circle
    

textNumber = new text
    innerText = toStirng
